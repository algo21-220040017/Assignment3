Some researchers think that the investors' emotions could affect the price of assets and futhermore affect the return of assets. Malcolm Baker & Jeffrey Wurgler(2006) used PCA(Priciple Component Analysis) and comstruct an investor emotion factor with 6 observable variables. Dashan Huang(2013) found that PLS(Partial Least-square Method) is also an efficient way to construct investor emotion factors to predict the return of stock returns.

In this job, I construct a MySQL database contains multiple possible variables related to investors' emotions. The python files in ./db/ implement the functions of creating the tables(if you haven't created one) and updating the data. In advance of running these files, you first need to construct two schemas "emotions" and "stock_index" in your MySQL database and revise the database address in ./db/configuration.py
